POLYMORPHISM

MULTIPLE INHERITANCE 
It is possible to derive a new class from more than one base class.

class Horse{

}

class Bird{

}

class Pegasus: public Horse, public Bird
{

}


AMBIGUITY RESOLUTION
both parent class might have same method. you will get compiler error.

you can resolve this ambiguity with an explicit call to the function you wish to invoke.
COLOR currentColor = pPeg->Horse::GetColor();

VIRTUAL INHERITANCE 
while calling horse and bird in pagasus, constructor of animal is called 2 times.
This can be fixed by.

class Horse: virtual public animal
class Bird: virtual public animal 
class Pegasus : public Horse, public Bird 


Do use multiple inheritance when new class needs functions and features from more than
one base class.
Do use virtual inheritance when most class has one shared base class.
Don't use multiple inheritance when single inheritance will do. 



ABSTRACT DATA TYPES: represents a concept rather than an object. In C++, and ADT is
always the base class to other classes, and it is not valud to make an instance of an ADT.


PURE VIRTUAL FUNCTIONS 
a virtual function is made pure by initializing it with zero.

virtual void Draw() = 0;
