EXPRESSIONS AND STATEMENTS

Statements: A statement controls the sequence of execution, evaluates an expression,
or does nothing.

Whitespace: is generally ignored in statements.

Blocks and Compound Statements: Any place you can put a single statement,
you can put a compond statement, also called a block. A block begins with an
opening braces.

Expressions: Anything that evaluates to a value is an expression in C++.

Operators: The assignment operator(=) causes the operand on the left side of 
the assignment operator to have its value changed to the value on the site size. 

Mathematical operators: +,-,*,/,%

Integer division and modulus: 

Increment and Decrement:

Precedence: Every operator has a precedence value.

Nesting Parentheses: For complex expressions, you might need to nest Parentheses
one withing another.

The Natuer of Truth:

The if statement:

INDENTATION STYLES:

if( experssion){
    statements
}

if( experssion)
{
    statements
}

if( experssion)
    {
    statements
    }


else statement:

Advanced if statements:

Using braces in Nested if Statements

Logical Operators:
    AND     &&
    OR      ||
    NOT     !

RELATIONAL PRECEDENCE: Like all expressiong, they have a prevedence order
that determines which relations are evaluated first.

CONDITIONAL( TERNARY ) OPERATOR 
The conditional operator (?:) is C++'s only ternary operator.

(expression 1) ? (expression 2) : (expression 3)
