VARIABLES AND CONSTANTS

A variable is a place to store information.

Setting Aside Memory: Whe we define a variable, we must tell compiler what kind
of variable it is: an integer, a character ... . This information tells the compiler
how much room to set aside and what kind of value you want to store.

Size of Integers: An interger might be two byters on one machine, 4 on another machine.

Signed and Unsigned: sometimes you need negative numbers. 

Fundamental variable types:
    unsigned short int  : 2 bytes 
    short int           : 2 bytes
    unsigned long int   : 4 bytes
    long int            : 4 bytes
    int                 : 2 bytes
    int                 : 2 bytes
    char                : 1 byte 
    float               : 4 bytes
    double              : 8 bytes

C++ is case sensitive.

Many programmer prefer to use all lowercase letter for their variable names.
If name requires two words, there are two popular conventions: my_car, myCar.

typedef: C++ enables you to create an alias for this phrase by using the keyword
'typedef', which stands for type definition.

$ typedef unsigned short int USHORT

Wrapping around an unsigned Integer: When an unsigned integer reaches its maximum
value, it wraps around and start over.

Wrapping around a signed Integer: When you run out of positive numbers, you run
right into the largest negative numbers and then count back down to 0.

CHARACTERS: computers do not know about letters, punctuation, or sentenses. all
they understand are numbers. 

In the ASCII code, the lowecase letter "a" is assigned the value 97.

Special Printing Characters 

\n      new line
\t      tab
\b      backspace
\"      double quote
\'      single quote
\?      question mark
\\      backslash

CONSTANTS 

Literal constants: is a value typed directly into your program wherever it is 
needed. "int myAge = 39;"

Symbolic Constants: A Symbolic constant is a constant that is represented by a name.

Enumerated Constants: enable you to create new types and then to define variables of
those types whose values are restricted to a set of possible values.

"enum COLOR {RED, BLUE, GREEN, WHITE, BLACK}"
or
"enum COLOR {RED=100, BLUR, GREEN=500,WHITE,BLACK=700}"
