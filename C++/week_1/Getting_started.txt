A program can be defined as either a set of written instructions created by a programmer or an executable piece of software.

# C++ and Object oriented programming

Four pillars of OOPS
- encapsulation
- data hiding
- inheritance
- polymorphism

The property of being self-contained is called encapsulation.
With encapsulation, one can achive data hiding.
Data hiding is the highly valued characteristic that an object can be used without
the user knowing or caring how it works internally.


ENCAPSULATION: hiding away data and code, and seperating it out.

INHERITANCE: allows child classes to inherit methods from parent classes.

POLYMORPHISM: allows child class to define their own behaviour while still 
    sharing meathods with parent class.

C++ is superset of C. Any legal C program is a legal C++ program.

ANSI STANDARD: Accredited Standards Commitee. An attempt to ensure C++ is
portable.

C++, more than other language, demands that the programmer design the program before 
writing it.

Most C++ compiler don't care what extension you give your source code.

CREATING AN EXECUTABLE FILE:
- Create source code filee, .cpp.
- Compile the source code into a file with .obj extension.
- Link onj file with any needed library to produce and executable program.
